# 3362. Zero Array Transformation III

# You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries where queries[i] = [li, ri].

# Each queries[i] represents the following action on nums:

# Decrement the value at each index in the range [li, ri] in nums by at most 1.
# The amount by which the value is decremented can be chosen independently for each index.
# A Zero Array is an array with all its elements equal to 0.

# Return the maximum number of elements that can be removed from queries, such that nums can still be converted to a zero array using the remaining queries. If it is not possible to convert nums to a zero array, return -1.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,0,2], queries = [[0,2],[0,2],[1,1]]

# Output: 1

# Explanation:

# After removing queries[2], nums can still be converted to a zero array.

# Using queries[0], decrement nums[0] and nums[2] by 1 and nums[1] by 0.
# Using queries[1], decrement nums[0] and nums[2] by 1 and nums[1] by 0.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,1,1,1], queries = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]

# Output: 2

# Explanation:

# We can remove queries[2] and queries[3].

# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[0,3]]

# Output: -1

# Explanation:

# nums cannot be converted to a zero array even after using all the queries.

 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
# 1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
# queries[i].length == 2
# 0 <= li <= ri < nums.length

# Solution:

import heapq
