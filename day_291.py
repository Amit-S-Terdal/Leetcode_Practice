# 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away

# Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
# Output: true
# Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
# Example 2:


# Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
# Output: false
# Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# 0 <= k <= nums.length
# nums[i] is 0 or 1




# Solution: 



class Solution(object):
    def kLengthApart(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        last = -float('inf')  # Use negative infinity to simulate "no 1" initially
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num == 1:
                if i - last - 1 < k:
                    return False
                last = i
        return True
