# 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence 

# Given two strings str1 and str2, return the shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences. If there are multiple valid strings, return any of them.

# A string s is a subsequence of string t if deleting some number of characters from t (possibly 0) results in the string s.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
# Output: "cabac"
# Explanation: 
# str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
# str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
# The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.
# Example 2:

# Input: str1 = "aaaaaaaa", str2 = "aaaaaaaa"
# Output: "aaaaaaaa"
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000
# str1 and str2 consist of lowercase English letters.


# Solution:
